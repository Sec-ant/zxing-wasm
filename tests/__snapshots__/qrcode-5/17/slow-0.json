  "text": "THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS<LF><LF>By Lewis Carroll<LF><LF><LF>CHAPTER I. Looking-Glass house<LF><LF>One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with<LF>it:--it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had<LF>been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of<LF>an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it<LF>COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.<LF><LF>The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the<LF>poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she<LF>rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and<LF>just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was<LF>lying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all<LF>meant for its good.<LF><LF>But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,<LF>and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great<LF>arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been<LF>having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been<LF>trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all<LF>come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all<LF>knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the<LF>middle.<LF><LF>'Oh, you wicked little thing!' cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and<LF>giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.<LF>'Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You OUGHT,<LF>Dinah, you know you ought!' she added, looking reproachfully at the old<LF>cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage--and then she<LF>scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted<LF>with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn't get on<LF>very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and<LF>sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to<LF>watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one<LF>paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it<LF>might.<LF><LF>'Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?' Alice began. 'You'd have guessed<LF>if you'd been up in the window with me--only Dinah was making you tidy,<LF>so you couldn't. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the<LF>bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it <LF>",
